Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github profile. My name is Prabashwara but I mostly use my nickname `bash` since most people find my name hard to pronounce. I am the lead frontend developer at Nuvole and I write a frontend blog called [Frontend undefined](https://www.frontendundefined.com).

If you stalk my profile, you will find my contributions to the [Internationational Labour Organization](https://github.com/international-labour-organization) as part of my work for Nuvole and my edits to the blog since it is a static site built using [eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev). I am currently writing a series of monthly posts about state management libraries for React and as a part of that, I created a sample web app called [Timo](https://www.frontendundefined.com/posts/monthly/sample-react-app/#meet-timo) which I will be refactoring every month to use a different library.
